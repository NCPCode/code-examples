####### 1) create two variables, and then print their sum


sdfg = 123
asdf = 332
print(sdfg + asdf)

####### 2) create a bunch of variables, and then print the result of an equation that uses every one of them




####### CHALLENGE 3) create all of the appropriate variables, plug them into the quadratic equation, and print the result (HINT: think about how a square root can be expressed with exponents)










###### You're done!
