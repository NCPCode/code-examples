def draw_shape(sides, length):
  # add some code which makes the turtle draw a shape with the given number of sides
  # for example, draw_shape(3, 10) would draw a triangle with sides of length 10
  # draw_shape(5, 6) would draw a pentagon with sides of length 6
  
# add something to test your code
